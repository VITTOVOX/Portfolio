An algorithm that ask a user to enter a positivie number repeatedly until the user enter a zero value, then determines and outputes the largest of the numbers that were input
Pseudo code
Begin
	Print "Enter a positivie number, Press 0 to end program"
	User_Input
	If input < 0 
	Then program Ends 
	If input > 0 
	Then user_inputer > largest_number 
	If user_inputer > largest_number 
	Set user_input as largest_number
	Else use_input is invalid 
	Print "Please try again"
	End

	An algorithm that reads an abitrary number of integers and then returns thir arithmetic average
	Pseudo code
	Begin
	Sum set to 0  // Store all numbers
	Count set 0  // Store all inputs
	
	Print "Please enter a integers or Type Done to finish"
	If user typed "Done" end program
	
	Convert User_Input to integers as number 
	Sum set to sum + number  // Add the input to Sum 
	Count set to + 1   // Increment count 
	End
	
	If user enter "0"
	Print "No numbers were Entered" 
	But else print "The numbers arithmetic average: "

	An algorithm that reads a grocery list and prints out the products (in alphabitcal order) that are still left to buy
	Pseudo code
	Begin

	Create  A empty list for grocery_list and Bought_Items
	Print "Please input the Items you need to buy then type Done to Make grocery list."
	IF item "Done" end 
	Add items to grocery_list
	
	Print "Please input items that have been bought, type Done with finished"
	If item "Done" end
	Add items to Bought_Items
	
	Determine Items still left to buy create a empty list items_left
	If list is empty 
	Print "All done!"
	Else Print eash item left in grocery_list
	END

	START -> READ X,Y -> S = X + Y  A = S/2 P = Xx Y -> write S, A, P, -> Stop
	Pseudo code
	BEGIN
    // Step 1: Read two numbers X and Y
    PROMPT "Enter the first number (X): "
    READ X

    PROMPT "Enter the second number (Y): "
    READ Y

    // Step 2: Perform calculations
    SET S TO X + Y          // Sum of X and Y
    SET A TO S / 2          // Average of X and Y
    SET P TO X * Y          // Product of X and Y

    // Step 3: Display results
    PRINT "Sum (S): ", S
    PRINT "Average (A): ", A
    PRINT "Product (P): ", P
